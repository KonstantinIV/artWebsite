        With the advancement of AI (Artificial Intelligence) tools, it is important to note that all my artworks are personally
            created by me <b>using traditional artistic techniques.</b>

            Consequences of using AI generated content :
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Brand damage:</b> Many people oppose content created by AI tools due to concerns about authenticity and ethics regarding the creation of AI tools, which can lead to reputation damage for brands.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    <b>Legal issues:</b> AI tools are often built on copyrighted material without proper compensation or authorization, leading to potential legal disputes when utilizing AI images in projects.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    <b>Copyright:</b> AI-created images lack originality and may raise issues surrounding copyright ownership and protection.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>            Why I choose not to use AI:        </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Bad ethics:</b> AI tools often exploit copyrighted works without permission, which goes against ethical principles. Using AI models trained on such data is unjust to the artists whose work is included.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    <b>Personal growth:</b> Relying on AI tools can hinder intellectual growth and create difficulties when facing new challenges without the aid of AI assistance.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    <b>Lack of authenticity:</b> I value the personal touch and uniqueness that comes from creating artwork by hand, expressing my own vision, emotions, and experiences.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            While AI has positive applications, it is essential to use it responsibly as an assisting tool rather than relying solely on AI-generated content.
