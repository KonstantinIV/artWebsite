                With the advancement of AI (Artificial Intelligence) tools, it
                is
                important to note that all my artworks are personally
                created by me <b>using traditional artistic techniques.</b>

                Consequences of using AI generated content :

                    <p>
                        <b>Brand damage:</b> Many people oppose content created
                        by
                        AI tools due to concerns about authenticity and ethics
                        regarding the creation of AI tools, which can lead to
                        reputation damage for brands.

                        <b>Legal issues:</b> AI tools are often built on
                        copyrighted
                        material without proper compensation or authorization,
                        leading to potential legal disputes when utilizing AI
                        images
                        in projects.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Copyright:</b> AI-created images lack originality and
                        may
                        raise issues surrounding copyright ownership and
                        protection.
                    </p>
                </li>

            <p> Why I choose not to use AI:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Bad ethics:</b> AI tools often exploit copyrighted
                        works
                        without permission, which goes against ethical
                        principles.
                        Using AI models trained on such data is unjust to the
                        artists whose work is included.

                        <b>Personal growth:</b> Relying on AI tools can hinder
                        intellectual growth and create difficulties when facing
                        new
                        challenges without the aid of AI assistance.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Lack of authenticity:</b> I value the personal touch
                        and
                        uniqueness that comes from creating artwork by hand,
                        expressing my own vision, emotions, and experiences.
                    </p>

            </ul>
            <p>
                While AI has positive applications, it is essential to use it
                responsibly as an assisting tool rather than relying solely on
                AI-generated content.
