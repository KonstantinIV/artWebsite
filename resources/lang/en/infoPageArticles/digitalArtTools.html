          With the advancement of AI (Artificial Intelligence) tools, it is
          important to note that all my artworks are personally created by me
          <strong>using traditional artistic techniques.</strong>

        <p>Potential consequences of using AI generated content :</p>
  
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Brand damage:</strong> Many people oppose content created by
              AI tools due to concerns about authenticity and ethics regarding the
              creation of AI tools, which can lead to reputation damage for
              brands.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Legal issues:</strong> AI tools are often built on
              copyrighted material without proper compensation or
              authorization,&nbsp;leading to potential legal disputes and issues
              when utilizing AI images in projects.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Copyright:</strong> AI-created images lack originality and
              may raise issues surrounding copyright ownership and protection.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Authenticity:&nbsp;</strong> If half or some of the content
              is made using AI then it can undermine all the other hard work that
              was done using the traditional ways.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>
          While AI has positive applications, it is essential to use it
          responsibly as an assisting tool rather than relying solely on
          AI-generated content. Relying on AI tools can hinder intellectual growth
          and create difficulties when facing new challenges without the aid of AI
          assistance.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding also that I am not entirely anti AI. There are also great AI
          tools that can help in optimizing workflows but some can be extremly
          damaging the way they are being used unfortunately.
