                    With the advancement of AI (Artificial Intelligence) tools, it is important to note that all my artworks are personally
                    created by me <b>using traditional artistic techniques.</b>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Why using AI-generated images can be problematic:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Brand damage:</b> Many people oppose content created by AI tools due to concerns about authenticity and ethics regarding the creation of AI tools, which can lead to reputation damage for brands.
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <li>
                            <b>Legal issues:</b> AI tools are often built on copyrighted material without proper compensation or authorization, leading to potential legal disputes when utilizing AI images in projects.
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <li>
                            <b>Copyright:</b> AI-created images lack originality and may raise issues surrounding copyright ownership and protection.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    Why I choose not to use AI:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Bad ethics:</b> AI tools often exploit copyrighted works without permission, which goes against ethical principles. Using AI models trained on such data is unjust to the artists whose work is included.
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <li>
                            <b>Personal growth:</b> Relying on AI tools can hinder intellectual growth and create difficulties when facing new challenges without the aid of AI assistance.
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <li>
                            <b>Lack of authenticity:</b> I value the personal touch and uniqueness that comes from creating artwork by hand, expressing my own vision, emotions, and experiences.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    While AI has positive applications, it is essential to use it responsibly as an assisting tool rather than relying solely on AI-generated content.
